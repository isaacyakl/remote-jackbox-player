Find and play Jackbox games remotely (even if you don't own any) all on a single screen! This website allows you to simultaneously watch a Jackbox stream and join the fun from one mobile device. You can find random game sessions hosted on Twitch and join or directly enter a stream URL (if your friend or family member is streaming their game)!

Try it on your mobile device üì≤
